# Audio Programming Assignment

As part of my MSc Acoustics and Music Technology in University of Edinburgh, I undertook an Audio Programming course mainly focused on C++ development and the JUCE framework. The brief for the final assignment, worth 60% of the course mark, was to implement a working audio plugin to demonstrate skills leaned on the course. 

For my submission, I implemented a velocity sensitive subtractive synthesiser with two primary oscillators, a noise oscillator and an LFO that could control a number of parameters. There is also a switchable low/high pass filter with an ADSR envelope and an amplifier section with an ADSR envelope and distortion effect. Finally, the synth included built in ping pong delay and reverb effects. The plugin is built on the JUCE framework and makes particular use of the JUCE ADSR envelopes and Reverb effects. 

The code in this repo is presented as it was submitted for the assignment.
